# Evolutionary-rescue-and-geographic-range-shifts-under-climate-change-for-global-amphibians
Dataset and R scripts dynamically model geographic distribution changes by coupling ENMs and ecoevolutionary mechanisms to assess the probability of evolutionary rescue (i.e., rapid adaptation) and dispersal under climate change for the world's amphibians.
