# Evolutionary-rescue-and-geographic-range-shifts-under-climate-change-for-global-amphibians
Dataset and R scripts dynamically model geographic distribution changes by coupling ENMs and ecoevolutionary mechanisms to assess the probability of evolutionary rescue (i.e., rapid adaptation) and dispersal under climate change for the world's amphibians.
This repository contains the main functions, input data and results of the manuscript.

#Analyses
The folders contain files to reproduce the analyses. 
There is a file named PAM_filtered.txt, which contains the presence-absence matrix of the current amphibians of the world, BIOS_modermPres_PAM_filtred.txt, and BIOS_moderfut_ccsm_rcp60_PAM_filtred.txt, which contains the environmental variables in conditions current and futures, and SD_ajust_FST_pop4.txt, with a vector of the standard deviation of Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter (Bio8; CCSM) of all amphibians species.
